\subsection{Dining Room Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Doubles as dining and sitting area
\item Stove in corner, may be used infrequently, certainly not a primary heat source for the room
\item Window-bench in corner, with some book and sundry storage - possibly under-seat? e.g. http://www.50degrees.co.uk/project/whitton-road/
\item LAN points
\item Plenty of power outlets
\item Direct access to the garden so some sort of sunken rug perhaps near the patio door.
\item Sliding patio doors, lift and slide preferred.
\item TV point in case we ever decide to put one near the stove in future, but could be dropped for costings if need be
\item Room on south wall for books, ``sideboard'' etc
    

\end{itemize}
