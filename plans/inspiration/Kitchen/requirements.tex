\subsection{Kitchen Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Open Plan
\item Handle-less Cabinets
\item Easy clean worktops
\item Bins under sink to utilize voided space?
\item Window behind sink into den?
\item Due to the angle of the wall, the units need to be offset circa 20cm from the wall to allow full door opening. Wine rack can go in here
    
\end{itemize}
