\subsubsection{Kids Bedroom Requirements}
The 2 kids bedrooms are slightly different sizes; I think it should be possible to make them both the same size by moving the adjoining wall east by 10cm, and the bathroom wall and door east by 10 cm also. This would allow them both to have the same floor space

\begin{itemize}
\item Room for bed with rolling pullout for sleepovers. 
\item Room for bunks, to allow sharing or sleepovers
\item Built in wardrobe, mirror
\item Desk for study, play, dressing
\item Network port for future computer connection
\item Power points in all corners
\item No TV points
\end{itemize}
