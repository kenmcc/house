\subsubsection{Master Bedroom Requirements}
The master bedroom has large windows on 2 walls, so storage may be compromised at these locations. 
Chests of drawers can go under the windows, and full-height wardrobes in the "blind" corner.

\begin{itemize}
\item Queen sized bed, bedside lockers either side
\item Built in wardrobes, to ceiling.
\item Power sockets either side of bed for reading lights, chargers etc
\item Power sockets near windows for hairdryers etc
\item No TV socket
\item Lan socket just in case there's ever a need to use a computer here - perhaps one near bed, one near west window?
\item Push ensuite-wall northwards by circa 50cm to allow wardrobe or storage along this? Perhaps flush-mount the door to the en-suite level with the front of the storage

\end{itemize}
