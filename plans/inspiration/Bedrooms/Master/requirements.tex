\subsubsection{Master Bedroom Requirements}
The master bedroom has large windows on 2 walls, so storage may be compromised at least at height. Chests of drawers can go under the windows, and full-height wardrobes in the "blind" corner.

\begin{itemize}
\item Built in wardrobes, to ceiling.
\item Power sockets either side of bed for reading lights, chargers etc
\item Power sockets near windows for hairdryers etc
\item No TV socket
\item No Lan socket

\end{itemize}
