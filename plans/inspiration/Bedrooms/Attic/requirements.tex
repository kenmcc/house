\subsubsection{Attic Bedroom Requirements}
The Attic bedroom will be initially used as a guest bedroom, but may in future be given to one of the kids if need be. Will probably have under-eaves access.
It has a window to the east and 2 velux rooflights.

\begin{itemize}
\item Small double bed, probably our current one 
\item No or limited built in furniture, probably need to be able to move some stuff to access under-eaves storage.
\item Possible storage which rolls into eaves, drawers etc
\item Lan connection point
\item Power points in all corners
\end{itemize}
