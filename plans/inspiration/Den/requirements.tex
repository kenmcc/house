\subsection{Den Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Space for kids to have their own room, to play in initially and then to use as tv/gaming room when they get older. May also be used as study/computer room

\item Pocket door to maximize space, also prevent fingers getting caught
\item Solid door to allow room to be closed off from visiting eyes if messy
\item Plenty of storage, some seating area. Probably not built in as may be changed in future to allow sofas, bean bags etc for lounging.
\item TV point, but no TV initially installed
\item LAN point
\item Power Points in all corners

\end{itemize}
