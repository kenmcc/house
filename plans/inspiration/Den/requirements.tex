\subsection{Den Requirements}
A space for the kids to have their own room initially for playing in, but to be converted to a gaming/tv/homework room
when they get a bit older. May also be used as study/computer room

Possibly to also have this room and the main sitting room combined further down the line when the kids no longer need it.
\begin{itemize}
\item Pocket door to maximize space, also prevent fingers getting caught
\item Solid (i.e. not glazed) door to allow room to be closed off from visiting eyes if messy
\item Plenty of storage, some seating area. Probably not built in as may be changed in future to allow sofas, bean bags etc for lounging.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Electrical}
\begin{itemize}
\item TV Location but no TV initially installed : 2 x Coax (DVBS, DVBT), 1 lan (HDMI OVER), 1 double socket on the wall, (probably East).
\item LAN point near pocket door/kitchen corner for data
\item Double Socket in all corners
\end{itemize}
